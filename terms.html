                    <h2>7. Subscription and Payments</h2>
                    <h3>Subscription Plans</h3>
                    <p>CookYum offers certain premium features which require payment ("Subscription"). By selecting a Subscription you agree to pay CookYum the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for a Subscription and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
                    <p>Unless you notify us before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a Subscription, your Subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Subscription (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
                    <p>CookYum, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. CookYum will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Refunds</h3>
                    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by CookYum on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of CookYum.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cancellation</h3>
                    <p>You may cancel your Subscription at any time by logging into your account or contacting us using the contact information provided below. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current paid term.</p>

                    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>

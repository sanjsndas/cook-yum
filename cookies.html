Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser when you visit our website. They help us make the Service work properly, make it more secure, provide better user experience, and understand how the Service performs and where it needs improvement.</p>
                    <p>This policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy which explains more about how we collect, use, and protect your personal information including through the use of cookies and similar technologies.

                    <h2>2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer, smartphone, or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.</p>
                    <p>Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting ("first-party cookies") or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third-party cookies"). Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies like "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies.</p>
                    <p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are "session cookies," meaning they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are "persistent cookies," meaning they survive after your browser is closed and can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you later reopen your browser.</p>

                    <h2>3. How We Use Cookies</h2>
                    <p>We use cookies for several purposes, which we've explained in detail below. The cookies we use may vary depending on the specific Service you're using. We use both session and persistent cookies on our Service and we use different types of cookies to run the Service:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are necessary to provide you with services available through our Service and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
                    <p>For example, essential cookies help remember your preferences as you navigate the site during a single browsing session. They also help with load balancing to make sure our content remains up during peak usage times. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Service, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Service works.</p>
                    <p>We use Google Analytics cookies to help us understand how our visitors engage with the Service. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. The cookies store information about what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies allow our Service to remember choices you make when you use our Service, such as remembering your language preference, login details, or the region you are in. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use our Service.</p>
                    <p>For example, we use functionality cookies to remember your preferred recipe categories or dietary preferences so we can show you more relevant content when you return to our site. These cookies may also be used to remember changes you've made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</p>
                    <p>We use these cookies to connect with social networks like Facebook and Pinterest, which may use information about your visit to target advertising to you on other websites. The advertising cookies on our site may be placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.</p>

                    <p>Some browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that, when turned on, signals to websites and online services that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no industry standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals, so our Service does not currently respond to DNT browser signals or mechanisms.</p>
                    <p>We continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Cookies Policy.</p>
